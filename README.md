# 2020-Lvl1Practice
This is the code for passing level 1 of coding.
The activity is to make a motor run with a button on the controller.

Try not to copy, all referencing can be done through the RevRobotics documentation and the WPILib documentation.
(Trust me it's a lot more rewarding having your code work than someone elses code.)
